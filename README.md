# ScentSnap

##Creator's Story

The sense of smell is invisible to our eyes, but it has the power to control people's living space unconsciously.

I participated in the exhibition production and operation of a special exhibition called "Rediscovery of Fragrance" held at the Busan National Science Museum for four months in 2022. The concept of this exhibition is to provide users with an experience that can supplement or maximize the understanding of smell in the cognitive domain through other senses of sight, hearing, and touch.

In the exhibition, there was 'My Favorite Fragrance Finding Zone'. There, a viewer who looked like a third grader of elementary school said this to me. "I like the smell of my mother. Smelling my mom makes me feel good! But now I'm so sad that I can't smell my mother's scent." That's when I wanted to record my child's scent.

There is a camera for recording visual information and a recorder for recording auditory information, but there is no device for recording olfactory information so far. Unlike vision and hearing, olfactory sense does not have terms or codes that can be expressed or described.

However, smell adds emotion to memory. I took note of this.

So I came up with a "ScentSnap" application that reads the person's emotions, brings back memories, and records the scent with images.
